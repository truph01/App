# Upgrade From a Personal Workspace to the Collect Plan

If you previously paid for a personal workspace (Track or Submit), your workspace has been upgraded to the **Collect** plan.

This article explains:

- What changed
- What stayed the same
- How billing works now
- What to expect going forward

Your expense data and reports remain intact.

---

## Who Is Affected by the Collect Plan Upgrade

This applies to you if:

- You previously used a paid **personal workspace** (Track or Submit), and  
- You were billed directly by Expensify (not through Apple’s App Store)

If you subscribe through Apple (In-App Purchase), this change does not apply.

## What Happens During the Collect Plan Upgrade

When your workspace is upgraded, we:

When your workspace was upgraded, we:

1. Created a new **Collect** workspace
2. Copied your relevant settings from your personal workspace
3. Moved your reports and expenses to the Collect workspace
4. Set the Collect workspace as your default workspace
5. Canceled your personal SmartScan subscription
6. Hid the Individual workspace settings to prevent duplicate configuration

---

## What Settings Are Copied to the Collect Plan

We copy commonly used configuration from your personal workspace, including:

- Workspace name
- Categories
- Tags (if enabled)
- Tax settings (if enabled)
- Distance rates (if enabled)

Certain advanced features (like Rules, Accounting integrations, Expensify Card, and Per Diem) are not automatically enabled. You can enable them in your workspace, though some may require upgrades to our Control plan.

---

## How Submit Workspaces Work After the Collect Plan Upgrade

If you previously had a Classic Submit personal workspace and used the **“Submit my expenses to”** setting:

- The submit email is added as a workspace member on your Collect workspace
- Approvals are enabled
- That person is set as the approver using a basic approval workflow

This replaces the legacy submit-only flow with a standard approval workflow available on the Collect plan.

You now have access to more flexible approval controls if needed.

---

## What Changes With Billing on the Collect Plan

After the upgrade:

- You are billed under **Collect plan pricing**
- Billing is based on workspace members

### Collect Plan Billing for Submit Workspaces With 2 Members
To make the transition smooth for customers that submit expenses to others in Expensify using our previous Classic Submit plan, we're applying a discount.
To make the transition smooth for customers who submit expenses to others in Expensify using our previous Classic Submit plan, we're applying a discount.

If your workspace has:

- One submitter (Workspace Owner), and  
- One approver  

You are billed for **one member only**.

A “customer appreciation discount” is automatically applied to prevent your cost from increasing for equivalent functionality.

---

## What Features Are Included in the Collect Plan

The Collect plan includes:

- Custom approval workflows
- Accounting integrations (QuickBooks Online, Xero)
- Workspace rules
- Expensify Travel
- Access to New Expensify
- Real-time collaboration and chat
- AI-powered categorization via Concierge

This upgrade allows full access across web and mobile.

## How to Manage Workspace Settings After the Collect Plan Upgrade

Your workspace is now classified as a **Group workspace** in Expensify Classic.
Your workspace is accessible in the Workspaces tab in New Expensify.

### On Expensify Classic Web:
Use the navigation tabs on the left and go to:

`Settings > Workspaces > Group > [Workspace Name]`

### On New Expensify Web:

Use the navigation tabs on the left and go to:

`Workspaces > [Workspace Name]`

### On New Expensify Mobile:
Use the navigation tabs on the bottom and go to:

`Workspaces > [Workspace Name]`

You can configure approvals, categories, billing, and integrations from there.

---

## What Happens to Per Diem on the Collect Plan

Per Diem is **not available** on the Collect plan.

If you previously created Per Diem expenses and need to continue using that feature, you’ll need to upgrade your workspace to the **Control** plan.

---

## Can You Delete the Collect Workspace After Migration

Yes.

If you no longer need the upgraded workspace, you can delete it. Your expenses will remain accessible.

If you are part of another paid workspace, you can continue using both, or delete this one if it is no longer needed.

---

## What Happens to Your Personal Workspace

We're deprecating the Personal Workspace.

- You can no longer configure it
- You cannot create new expenses on it
- All expense activity should now occur in your Collect workspace or any other accessible workspace you choose

---

## Do You Need to Take Action for the Collect Plan Upgrade

No action is required.

Your data has been migrated automatically.

If you have questions about billing, approvals, or workspace settings, reach out to Concierge in-app for help.

# FAQ

## Will I lose any expense data during the Collect Plan migration?

No. All reports, expenses, and receipts are moved to your new Collect workspace.

## Why was my SmartScan subscription canceled?

Personal SmartScan subscriptions are replaced by Collect plan billing. Unlimited SmartScans are included in Collect pricing.

## Why is my workspace now labeled as Group?

All Collect workspaces are classified as Group workspaces. This enables approvals, integrations, and other business features.

## Why am I only billed for one member even though there are two people?

If your workspace was migrated from a Submit personal workspace and has only one submitter and one approver, a discount is automatically applied to maintain your prior pricing.

## Does this change affect Apple subscriptions?

No. Apple In-App Purchase subscriptions are handled separately.
