# FAQ

## Why don’t I see the Time tab in my workspace?

The **Time** tab only appears after Time Tracking is enabled by a Workspace Admin. If you don’t see it, confirm that Time Tracking has been turned on in **Workspaces > Workspace Name > More Features**.

## Can different members have different hourly rates?

No, the default hourly rate applies to all time expenses created on the workspace.

## Can I change the default hourly rate later?

Yes. Workspace Admins can update the default hourly rate at any time by going to **Workspaces > Workspace Name > Time**.

## What happens to existing time entries if I change the default hourly rate?

Changing the default hourly rate only affects new time entries. Existing time entries keep the hourly rate that was applied when they were created.
