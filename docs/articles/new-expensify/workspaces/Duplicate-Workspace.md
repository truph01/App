# FAQ

## Does duplicating a workspace copy approval workflows?
Yes. If you select **Workflows** when duplicating, all approval steps and settings from the original workspace will carry over.

## Can I change which workspace settings are copied after duplication?
No. Once the new workspace is created, you’ll need to manually adjust any settings you didn’t include during duplication.

## Does duplicating a workspace affect the original one?
No. The original workspace remains unchanged. Duplication creates a separate, independent workspace with the settings you selected.

## Can I rename or delete a duplicated workspace later?
Yes. You can rename or delete any workspace at any time under **Workspaces > Settings > Workspace Info**.
