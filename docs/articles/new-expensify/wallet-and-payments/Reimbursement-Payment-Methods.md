# How to choose a reimbursement method for approved reports

Workspace Admins can choose between two reimbursement methods when paying an approved report in Expensify:

- **Direct reimbursement** — Expensify sends payment from a connected Workspace business bank account to a member’s connected personal bank account. This includes US ACH reimbursement and Global Reimbursement.
- **Pay elsewhere** — The Workspace Admin marks the report as paid in Expensify and issues payment outside the platform. Expensify records the report as paid but does not process the transfer.

The payment method is selected when the Workspace Admin clicks **Pay** on an approved report.

Available payment types depend on the location of the Workspace’s business bank account.

  ACH reimbursement is used for payments in USD from a US business bank account to a US personal deposit account. [Learn how to set up ACH reimbursement](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/wallet-and-payments/Connect-a-Business-Bank-Account).
