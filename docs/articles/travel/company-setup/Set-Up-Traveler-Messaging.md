# Traveler Messaging

Traveler messaging allows Travel Admins to create targeted messages for employees booking travel. Messages can appear as in-app banners in the Travel tool or be delivered by email.

Use Traveler messaging to share policy reminders, travel advisories, booking deadlines, or other important updates. For best results, keep messages short and clear. Messages under 120 characters are more likely to be read and understood quickly.
