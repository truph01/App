When writing or modifying source code, follow the Expensify coding standards.
Standards are defined in `.claude/skills/coding-standards/rules/`.

Categories:
- PERF-*: Performance — renderItem optimization, memo patterns, useEffect hygiene, data selection
- CONSISTENCY-*: Code consistency — no magic values, no unused props, ESLint disable justification
- CLEAN-REACT-PATTERNS-*: Architecture — composition over config, component ownership, narrow state

Read the specific rule file for detailed conditions, examples, and DO NOT flag exceptions before flagging a violation.
